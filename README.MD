# About new download method
The [Hi3Helper.Sophon](https://github.com/CollapseLauncher/Hi3Helper.Sophon) library is written in C# which would take some time to integrate into a Python project or rewrite. So I took advantage of existing C# front end projects and ported them to Linux (at least no need to run wine every time). See [HK4E-Sophon-Downloader](https://github.com/CleveTok3125/HK4E-Sophon-Downloader-Linux/).
